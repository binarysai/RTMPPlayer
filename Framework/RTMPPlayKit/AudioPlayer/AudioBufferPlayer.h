/*
 * This block is invoked when the AudioBufferPlayer needs a buffer to be
 * filled up with audio data.
 *
 * The block must fill buffer->mAudioData with up to mAudioDataBytesCapacity
 * bytes of audio data.
 * 
 * The block must set buffer->mAudioDataByteSize to the number of bytes of
 * valid audio data that it wrote in the buffer.
 *
 * Writing 0 bytes is not recommended. If you have nothing to output, then it
 * is better to do:
 *
 *     memset(buffer->mAudioData, 0, buffer->mAudioDataBytesCapacity);
 *     buffer->mAudioDataByteSize = buffer->mAudioDataBytesCapacity;
 *
 * This method is called from an internal Audio Queue thread, so you may need 
 * to synchronize access to any shared objects it uses.

/*
 * AudioBufferPlayer makes it easy for you to do sound synthesis.
 *
 * It sets up an Audio Session and an Audio Queue for playback of live audio. 
 * You only have to provide a block that is responsible for filling up the
 * audio buffers. 
 *
 * A bit of terminology:
 * - sample rate: the number of frames that is processed per second
 * - frame: a pair of left+right samples for stereo; a single sample for mono
 * - packet: because we are using uncompressed audio, a packet is the same as
 *   a frame (i.e. there is always 1 frame per packet)
 * - sample: a single 8, 16, 24 or 32-bit value from an audio waveform 
 *
 * You have options for specifying the sample rate, stereo or mono, and the
 * bit-depth of the output buffers. 
 * 
 * Note: The buffers are always assumed to be little-endian (both on simulator
 * and on a device).
